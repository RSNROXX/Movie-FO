<h4>Problem Statement<h4> 
<p>
  The main goal is to create a user interface where people may get information about movies. Single Page Applications built using React are more effective, secure, and rapid, which benefits users by allowing them to access any area of the web application quickly and with less waiting time. This software was created with the utmost desire to give its movie-obsessed users the most information possible.

<h4>Introduction</h4>  
<p>
   Over the past decade, social media and social networking sites such as book my show, IMDB, film.com for movie reviews have proliferated. It is a hectic, tedious, difficult and time-consuming task for movie viewers to read all movie reviews, resulting in inadequate ratings and opinions about the movie. Instead of referring to newspapers that only have 5 star ratings, this is usually incorrect.
  We propose a Web Application that manages the movie reviews given by various viewers to the movie. In this the viewers can see how the movie is to various other viewers and make a decision whether to watch the thought movie. It will show the overall rating of the movie which will change as the movie viewers enter the movie review.
