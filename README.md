<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

This software was created with the utmost desire to give its movie-obsessed users the most information possible.

<h3>Introduction</h3>  
<p>
   Over the past decade, social media and social networking sites such as book my show, IMDB, film.com for movie reviews have proliferated. It is a hectic, tedious, difficult and time-consuming task for movie viewers to read all movie reviews, resulting in inadequate ratings and opinions about the movie. Instead of referring to newspapers that only have 5 star ratings, this is usually incorrect.
  We propose a Web Application that manages the movie reviews given by various viewers to the movie. In this the viewers can see how the movie is to various other viewers and make a decision whether to watch the thought movie. It will show the overall rating of the movie which will change as the movie viewers enter the movie review.
